# Hi 👋, I'm Larris!

### About Me
- 🎓 CS student at the University of Waterloo
- 💼 Interning at Shopify as a SWE this summer
- ☀️ Seeking 2026 Summer internships

In the past, I've conducted research at the University of Waterloo on federated learning and transformers, published a [research paper](https://jhss.scholasticahq.com/article/85172-a-machine-learning-approach-to-detect-fraudulent-customers-based-on-their-financial-transaction-history) on training ML models to detect financial fraud, and benchmarked [object detection pipelines](https://github.com/Profilist/Autonomous-Driving) for self-driving cars using different neural networks.

I've also made a [trivia game](https://www.playonthedot.com/) with 7000+ plays, won 10+ [hackathons](https://devpost.com/larris-xie), and automated web scraping and built landing pages from scratch at a startup, check out my website [(www.larris.me)](https://www.larris.me) to see more!

### I'm currently learning about
- finetuning LLMs for rhythm games
- low level systems design and operating systems
